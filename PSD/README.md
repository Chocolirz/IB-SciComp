# PSD
This repository contains the Python code for expeirment 5: Faraday rotation in glass.

Code downloaded from [this website](https://people.phy.cam.ac.uk/db106/pub/)

## Recommended Operation
Simply run ```python PSD.py``` in the command line to run the code. Choose the correct channel, and carefully rotate the analyser to perform dithering. 

The mean value would vary with time, you should wait several rounds to let it settle down after every rotation. But you will be able to see clearly whether it is positive or negative. 

You could control the mean to as small as $10^{-7}$, if you can't, think about how to rotate the analyser by just a bit! (I've tried, even a blow could change the angle, and the effect was clearly readable on the screen.)
