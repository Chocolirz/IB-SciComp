# IB Scientific Computing

This repository contains the materials for the IB Computing course and some other computing-related problems during the 2024~2025 academic year at the University of Cambridge. 

Nothing hard, just some notes and exercises. Enjoy!

## Michaelmas Term 2024/2025
### Scientific Computing
+ [Session 1: Simple adder](https://github.com/Chocolirz/IB-SciComp/blob/main/SimpleAdder_plus_PolynomialSolver.py)
+ [Session 2: Oscillation](https://github.com/Chocolirz/IB-SciComp/blob/main/Oscillator_Visualiser.py)
+ [Session 3: Monte Carlo (MC)](https://github.com/Chocolirz/IB-SciComp/blob/main/MonteCarlo.py)
+ [Session 4: Method of Bisection](https://github.com/Chocolirz/IB-SciComp/blob/main/Method_of_Bisection.py)
+ [Session 5: Planets](https://github.com/Chocolirz/IB-SciComp/blob/main/Planet_Simulation.py)
+ [Session 6: Collisions](https://github.com/Chocolirz/IB-SciComp/blob/main/Collisions.py)

### Experimental Methods
+ [Q1: Fast Fourier Transform](https://github.com/Chocolirz/IB-SciComp/blob/main/Experimental_Methods_Problem_1.ipynb)
+ [Q17: Linear fit](https://github.com/Chocolirz/IB-SciComp/blob/main/Experimental_Methods_Problem_17.ipynb)
+ [Q18: The $\chi^2$ test](https://github.com/Chocolirz/IB-SciComp/blob/main/Experimental_Methods_Problem_18.ipynb)

### Oscillations, Waves, and Optics
+ [Q7: Simple Pendulum at large angles](https://github.com/Chocolirz/IB-SciComp/blob/main/OWO_Q7.ipynb)
+ [Q15: Reflection and transmission coefficients](https://github.com/Chocolirz/IB-SciComp/blob/main/OWO_Q15.ipynb)

### Physics Practicals
+ Experiment 6: Hysteresis used [this project](https://github.com/Chocolirz/IB-SciComp/tree/main/picoscope) to collect data from a picoscope (2206A).
+ Experiment 5: Faraday Rotation used [this project](https://people.phy.cam.ac.uk/db106/pub/) in the PSD folder during dythering. The project was almost flawless, so there's no need to apply any modifications.
+ Experiment 4: Funky pendulum. I didn't have time to look into this, so I just used [Zhen's original version](https://github.com/Zzzzhen1/Funky_Pendulum). 

### Additional
+ Yiran Ma (Peterhouse College) suggested that it's cool to do visualisation of collisions that can estimate $\pi$. I've done the basic calculations [here](https://github.com/Chocolirz/IB-SciComp/blob/main/pi_using_collisions.py). The topic is indeed interesting, but I don't think it's a good way to estimate $\pi$ (see the short notes at the end of the script). It's always better to use MC.
